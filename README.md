# Migration from 0.x to 1.x

This content has been moved to our [documentation](https://docs.fit-pay.com/SDK/iOS/migration/)

# Contributing to the SDK
We welcome contributions to the SDK. For your first few contributions please fork the repo, make your changes and submit a pull request. Internally we branch off of develop, test, and PR-review the branch before merging to develop (moderately stable). Releases to Master happen less frequently, undergo more testing, and can be considered stable. For more information, please read:  [http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
